# Euler â†” Quaternion Converter

This Python script provides simple functions and an interactive CLI to convert between **Euler angles** (roll, pitch, yaw) and **quaternions** `[w, x, y, z]`.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Convert Euler angles (in degrees) to quaternions  
- Convert quaternions to Euler angles (in degrees)  
- Handles normalization internally  
- Includes a small test function to verify round-trip conversions
